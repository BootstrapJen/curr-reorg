= Flags of the World (Capstone Project)

*Students demonstrate what they’ve learned about image composition, coordinates, and proportions to recreate a nation’s flag with code.*

|===
|Lesson Goals
|Students will be able to:

* Decompose a composite image into its component parts
* Accurately recreate an image using coordinates and proportions


|Student-Facing Lesson Goals
|
* I can break down a complex image into smaller images.
* I can describe a position in the first quadrant using coordinates.
* I can describe the dimensions of a shape using proportions (ex: a flag that is 200x300 has a height:width ratio of 2:3)


|Key Points for the Facilitator
|
* Encourage students to choose a flag that represents an appropriate challenge to them.  
  
* Students may not realize right away that they don’t need to define repeated elements as individual values, such as defining 7 separate, identical stripes for the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Liberia[flag of Liberia].  Ask students to figure out the fewest number of elements they need to define in order to create their flag.

* Students might choose a flag that contains an emblem that can't be recreated using geometric shapes, such as the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Mexico[flag of Mexico].  These emblems can be found through an online image search and brought in using bitmap/url and scaled to the appropriate size.  


|Prerequisites
|
* Students should be familiar with Circles of Evaluation.
* Students should be familiar with image manipulation functions.
