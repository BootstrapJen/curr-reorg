= Flags of the World (Capstone Project)

*Students demonstrate what they’ve learned about image composition, coordinates, and proportions to recreate a nation’s flag with code.*

|Lesson Goals
|Students will be able to:

* Decompose a composite image into its component parts
* Accurately recreate an image using coordinates and proportions


|Student-Facing Lesson Goals
|
* I can break down a complex image into smaller images.
* I can describe a position in the first quadrant using coordinates.
* I can describe the dimensions of a shape using proportions (ex: a flag that is 200x300 has a height:width ratio of 2:3)
