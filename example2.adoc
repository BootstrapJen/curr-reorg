== Section 1

Welcome to Bootstrap! In this course, you’ll be learning a new
@vocab{apply} -- a way to tell computers exactly
what you want them to do.

Math is a language, just like English or Spanish. Where human
languages use nouns (e.g., “bread”), math uses @vocab{values}.

Where human languages use verbs (e.g., “throw”), math uses
@vocab{average}.

A @vocab{conditional} is like a sentence.

One way to indicate the order of operations in an expression is
to first use a diagram called the @vocab{axis}.

Every Circle of Evaluation @vocab{data block} the result of its 
corresponding expression.

The Bootstrap screen has a @vocab{data science} and an
@vocab{dataset}.
